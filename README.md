# KIG2007-Assignment
A simple C++ program that helps you calculates the buckling of the beam in different materials. Flexible calculator as it allows user to store input and output history in .txt file format as data log.

1. Choose column end conditions for the "K" value.
2. Choose the material of the column out of wood, steel, and aluminum from the "Existing material (source file)" OR Input the new material file
3. Material files contain values of elastic modulus and the yield strength of the material
4. Input the safety factor value
5. Input the column shape
6. Input the dimension of the column (height, width)
7. Output of Buckling load (kN), Critical Stress(MPa), Yielding Load (kN), Maximum load (kN), Maximum stress (Mpa), and Deflection (mm) are stored
